## Data Flow

```
FixturesView (parent)
  └─> PrizesAnalyticsView
       ├─> trpc.prizes.listByPool (fetch prizes)
       ├─> trpc.pools.getById (fetch pool details)
       ├─> trpc.leaderboard.get (fetch user rank)
       │
       ├─> PrizePoolHero (hero section)
       ├─> MyPotentialPrizes (user opportunities)
       ├─> PrizesGrid (all prizes)
       └─> PoolStatsCards (pool statistics)
            ├─> trpc.pools.getRegistrations (participant count)
            └─> trpc.fixtures.listBySeason (match stats)
```

## tRPC Procedures Used

### Existing Procedures
- `trpc.prizes.listByPool` - Fetch prizes for pool
- `trpc.pools.getById` - Fetch pool details
- `trpc.pools.getRegistrations` - Fetch registrations for stats
- `trpc.leaderboard.get` - Fetch leaderboard with user rank
- `trpc.fixtures.listBySeason` - Fetch matches for stats

### No New Procedures Required
All necessary data is available through existing tRPC procedures.

## Prize Types Supported

| Type | Icon | Label (es-MX) |
|------|------|---------------|
| CASH | DollarSign | Efectivo |
| DISCOUNT | Percent | Descuento |
| SERVICE | Briefcase | Servicio |
| DAY_OFF | Calendar | Día Libre |
| EXPERIENCE | Sparkles | Experiencia |
| OTHER | Gift | Otro |

## Rank Badge Variants

- **1st Place**: `default` variant (gold/primary color)
- **2nd-3rd Place**: `purple` variant (purple/accent color)
- **4th+ Place**: `outline` variant (subtle border)

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile (< 640px)**: 1 column grid
- **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**: 2 column grid
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: 3 column grid

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML (headings, sections)
- Alt text for prize images
- Color contrast for text on gradient backgrounds
- Keyboard navigation support (via shadcn/ui components)
- Screen reader friendly labels

## Performance Considerations

- Parallel data fetching (prizes, pool, leaderboard)
- Conditional queries (fixtures only if seasonId exists)
- SportsLoader for consistent loading UX
- Optimized re-renders (React.memo not needed due to small component tree)
- Backdrop blur effects for glassmorphism design
- GPU-accelerated CSS animations

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to pool fixtures page
2. Click "Premios" tab
3. Verify hero section shows top prize
4. Check "Tus Oportunidades" section:
   - If in prize zone: green alert with prizes
   - If close: yellow alert with progress bar
   - If far: encouragement message
   - If not registered: CTA to register
5. Verify all prizes grid displays correctly
6. Check pool stats cards show accurate data
7. Test responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
8. Test empty state (pool with no prizes)

### Edge Cases
- Pool with no prizes configured
- User not registered in pool
- User with no rank (no predictions)
- Pool with only 1 prize
- Pool with 50+ prizes (grid overflow)
- Prize without image
- Prize without value
- Very long prize titles/descriptions

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Bonus Features (Not Implemented)
- [ ] Share prize on social media
- [ ] Prize details modal (click card for full details)
- [ ] Winners history (if pool finalized)
- [ ] Prize countdown timer
- [ ] Achievement badges
- [ ] Animations with Framer Motion
- [ ] Prize filters (by type, by rank range)
- [ ] "My vs Leader" comparison chart

### Potential Improvements
- Add prize terms & conditions field
- Add prize claim instructions
- Add prize redemption status
- Add prize sponsor logos
- Add prize eligibility criteria
- Add prize expiration dates

## Known Limitations

1. **No pagination**: All prizes loaded at once (acceptable for MVP, most pools have < 20 prizes)
2. **No real-time updates**: Leaderboard cached for 15-60s (acceptable for MVP)
3. **No prize filtering**: Shows all prizes (can add if needed)
4. **No prize search**: Not needed for small prize counts
5. **No prize sorting options**: Fixed sort by rank (can add if needed)

## Dependencies

### UI Components (from @qp/ui)
- Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent
- Badge
- Button
- SportsLoader (for loading states)

### Icons (from lucide-react)
- Trophy, Star, TrendingUp, AlertCircle
- DollarSign, Percent, Briefcase, Calendar, Sparkles, Gift
- Users, Target, Calendar

### Utilities
- next-intl (useTranslations)
- @web/trpc (trpc client)

## Design Updates (Post-Implementation)

### Style Refinements
After initial implementation, the following design improvements were applied:

1. **Glassmorphism Effect**: All cards now use `backdrop-blur-md bg-primary/10 border border-white/20` for a modern glass effect
2. **Color Scheme**: 
   - Headings use `text-accent` for better visibility
   - Secondary text uses `text-secondary`
   - Icons use `text-primary` for consistency
3. **Spacing**: Reduced from `space-y-8` to `space-y-4` and `space-y-2` for better density
4. **Badge Variants**: Changed 2nd-3rd place from `secondary` to `purple` for better visual hierarchy
5. **Tab Order**: Prizes tab moved before Stats tab in navigation
6. **Hero Section**: Simplified background, removed decorative blur circle, commented out prize type summary
7. **Loading States**: Replaced Skeleton components with SportsLoader for consistency

### Technical Fixes
- Fixed `pool.season.id` to `pool.seasonId` in PoolStatsCards
- Added `any` type annotation for leaderboard entry in PrizesAnalyticsView
- Removed duplicate TabsContent placement

## Conclusion

The Prizes & Analytics view is fully implemented and ready for testing. All components follow the project's conventions (.windsurfrules), use existing @qp/ui components, and maintain mobile-first responsive design. The implementation includes SportsLoader integration for consistent loading states across the application. The design has been refined with glassmorphism effects and optimized spacing for production use in the FIFA World Cup 2026 MVP.
