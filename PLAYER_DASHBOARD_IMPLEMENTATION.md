## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Player can see their registered pools
✅ Player can navigate to pool fixtures
✅ Player can submit predictions before kickoff
✅ Player cannot edit after kickoff (UI disabled + backend validation)
✅ Leaderboard updates in real-time (30s refresh)
✅ Mobile responsive (320px+)
✅ All strings in es-MX.json
✅ Dark mode support via tenant theme

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Dashboard Access**
   - Navigate to `/es-MX/dashboard`
   - Verify auth redirect if not logged in
   - Verify pools display after login

2. **Pool Fixtures**
   - Click "Ver partidos" on a pool card
   - Verify matches grouped by round
   - Test filter buttons (All, Pending, Live, Finished)

3. **Predictions**
   - Enter scores for an upcoming match
   - Click "Guardar pronóstico"
   - Verify toast notification
   - Verify prediction saved (refresh page)
   - Try editing before kickoff
   - Verify cannot edit after kickoff

4. **Leaderboard**
   - Switch to "Tabla de posiciones" tab
   - Verify current user highlighted
   - Wait 30s and verify auto-refresh
   - Check trophy icons for top 3

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on mobile (320px)
   - Test on tablet (768px)
   - Test on desktop (1024px+)

### Automated Testing (TODO)
```typescript
// Example test for prediction form validation
describe("PredictionForm", () => {
  it("should validate score range 0-99", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it("should disable form when match is locked", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it("should show success toast on save", () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Known Limitations

1. **No bulk prediction save** - Each prediction saves individually (could add later)
2. **No prediction history** - Only shows current prediction (could add modal with history)
3. **No match notifications** - No push/email notifications for upcoming matches (future feature)
4. **No social features** - No comments or reactions on matches (out of MVP scope)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Save** - Save all predictions at once with progress indicator
2. **Quick Predict** - Common score shortcuts (0-0, 1-0, 1-1, 2-1, etc.)
3. **Prediction Stats** - Personal stats dashboard (accuracy, streaks, etc.)
4. **Match Reminders** - Email/SMS notifications before kickoff
5. **Social Feed** - See friends' predictions (with privacy controls)
6. **Achievements** - Badges for milestones (10 exact scores, etc.)

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required - uses existing schema:
- `Pool`, `Registration`, `Match`, `Prediction`, `LeaderboardSnapshot`
- All tRPC routers already implemented in `packages/api`

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] All files created in correct locations
- [x] i18n messages added to es-MX.json
- [x] Components use existing UI library
- [x] tRPC hooks properly configured
- [x] Auth guards in place
- [x] Error boundaries implemented
- [x] Loading states implemented
- [x] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` to verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test on dev environment
- [ ] Test on staging with real data
- [ ] Performance audit (Lighthouse)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (a11y)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Auto-refresh** - Leaderboard refreshes every 30s (configurable)
2. **Query caching** - tRPC caches queries client-side
3. **Optimistic updates** - Predictions update UI immediately
4. **Image optimization** - Team logos should use Next.js Image component (future)
5. **Lazy loading** - Consider virtualizing long match lists (future)

## Accessibility

- ✅ Semantic HTML (forms, buttons, headings)
- ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus indicators
- ✅ Color contrast (primary/white on dark backgrounds)
- ⚠️ Screen reader testing needed
- ⚠️ Reduced motion preferences (future)

## Security

- ✅ Server-side auth validation
- ✅ Registration check before pool access
- ✅ Match lock validation (client + server)
- ✅ Input validation (zod schemas)
- ✅ CSRF protection (Next.js default)
- ✅ XSS protection (React escaping)
